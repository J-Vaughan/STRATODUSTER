Aircraft design characteristics are described to illustrate the challenges associated with the lofting and distribution of up to 15 tons of sulfate or calcite aerosol particulates per sortie at 20 Km (\~{}65,000 ft.). Aircraft aerodynamic, propulsion, structural and subsystem concepts and analyses are presented to validate the aircraft conceptual design.
